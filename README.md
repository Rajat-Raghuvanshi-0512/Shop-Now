# Getting Started with this project

# STEPS TO RUN THIS ENTIRE PROJECT ON PC

YOU NEED TO OPEN 2 TERMINALS TO START THIS APP AND SHOULD HAVE NODE.js INSTALLED

Step 1: Type "npm install" to install the dependencies and type "node index.js" to start the backend

Step 2: Open another terminal and go to client folder and type "npm install" again and then type "npm start" to run the application


You can also view this website by simply clicking on this link https://mernapp69.herokuapp.com/ but this website is not having the entire same functions as in the code i.e Payment Gateways etc.


Enjoy!!
